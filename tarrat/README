This is script to print very simple labels to Brother QL-800 label
printer. The printer would support much fancier labels, but I
specifically wanted just text labels and nothing else, without fancy
gui label designers or whatever.

This will just do single line labels, and this only works with
continuous label. For my settings, QL-800 cuts the label to correct
length. It will try to make font as large as it can fit to the label
length.

Note that the labels are always uppercased. This does not work very
well for umlauts or other national characters.

Usage:

First run this to set up unlimited paper length. Label width is the
parameter, 12,29,62 are known possibilities.

printlabel-init 12

Then you can either do

printlabel 'Any text'

or use

tarrat

which keeps reading label texts from input and printing them.

This only works in Linux, as QL-800 is not recognized in FreeBSD as a
printer.

This is very inefficent as it first generates label image as picture,
then turns that into postscript, and then cups will turn that
postscript Brother-compatible bitmap again. It would be better to
simply generate postscript directly.

The script needs at least the following packages to be installed, if
not included in your distro. I used debian and had to install plenty
of packages to get things working. The list may not be complete as I
could not easily list manually installed packages.

needed by source install of graphicsmagick/imagemagick:
       fontconfig, libfreetype6 (or later), libfreetype6-dev (or later),
       libconfconfig1-dev, jpeg-dev, libpng-dev, libtiff-dev

cups
gawk (workaround for broken tr)
graphicsmagic
imagemagick
netpbm
Brother drivers from brother website (contains brpapertoollpr_ql800)

graphicsmagic/imagemagick was not installing right on 32-bit computer,
so I needed to do source install. It might be more complete when
installed from package.
