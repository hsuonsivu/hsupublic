This reads data from cheap no-name chinese energy meter. The device
has a wireless transmitter which is supposed to read three phases, for
which 3 clamps are provided. It then sends the data wirelessly to usb
host device, which shows up as a serial power. Apparently it can read
16 channels, but I only had one transmitter. 

rc.conf-additions and powerwatcher-etc-rc are for FreeBSD. Could work
with some other unixes.

Bugs:

- I had no documentation on the protocol, and the only reference I
found was a python script which was available through Internet
Archive. Thus it was mostly testing and guessing to get it working.

- I could not figure out what the crc algorithm is, or for which part of the message it is calculated for. As a workaround, I included various sanity checks on the data received, but it will still sometimes receive obviously bogus messages.

- We also suspect that it really measures only one channel, as the
metering data does not really look right, or we need some magic
multiplier. However, we do not have a reference yet.

- No command line options, you need to modify LOGVERSION and debugging
data is printed if debug is set appropriately (two lowest bits do
something, use 3).
